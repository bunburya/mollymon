Mollymon is a tool for monitoring traffic to a Gemini server - it is written to work with Molly Brown, but can easily be
tweaked to work with any other server software that supports SCGI and logs data in a similar way.

Mollymon does two main things:

1. It can run as an SCGI application which allows visitors to a Gemini server to leave short messages for the admin.
2. It can generate short reports about the traffic to your capsule.
